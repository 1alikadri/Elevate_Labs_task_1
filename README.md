## 🧭 Overview
This repository contains the insights from performing a basic vulnerability assessment on my local system using **Nessus Essentials**, as part of my cybersecurity internship at **Elevate Labs**.

## 🎯 Objective
To identify common system vulnerabilities and gain hands-on experience in:
- Running a vulnerability scan
- Interpreting CVSS scores
- Understanding real-world risks on personal computers
- Learning the basics of risk prioritization and remediation

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Nessus Essentials** – Free vulnerability scanner
- **Windows 11** – Local machine as target
- **CVSS 3.1** – For severity rating


## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Gained practical experience with vulnerability scanning tools.
- Understood differences between scanning vs penetration testing.
- Learned how to prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and impact.
- Explored false positives and the importance of manual validation.

## 🚀 What I Learned
> "Every machine has blind spots—scanning reveals the shadows we often ignore. As a red teamer in training, knowing where to strike starts with knowing where you're weak."
