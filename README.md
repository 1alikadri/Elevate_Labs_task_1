# 🔍 Basic Vulnerability Scan - Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship

## 🧭 Overview
This repository contains the results and insights from performing a basic vulnerability assessment on my local system using **Nessus Essentials**, as part of my cybersecurity internship at **Elevate Labs**.

## 🎯 Objective
To identify common system vulnerabilities and gain hands-on experience in:
- Running a vulnerability scan
- Interpreting CVSS scores
- Understanding real-world risks on personal computers
- Learning the basics of risk prioritization and remediation

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Nessus Essentials** – Free vulnerability scanner
- **Windows 11** – Local machine as target
- **CVSS 3.1** – For severity rating

## 📊 Methodology
1. Installed and configured Nessus Essentials on local machine.
2. Set the scan target to `127.0.0.1` (localhost).
3. Ran a **Full System Scan**.
4. Analyzed the scan report and identified:
   - Total vulnerabilities found: **X**
   - Critical: **Y**
   - High: **Z**
   - Medium & Low: Documented selectively
5. Researched basic mitigation strategies for critical/high vulnerabilities.

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Gained practical experience with vulnerability scanning tools.
- Understood differences between scanning vs penetration testing.
- Learned how to prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and impact.
- Explored false positives and the importance of manual validation.

## 📁 Deliverables
- `screenshots/` – Contains all relevant screenshots.
- `scan_report.pdf` – Exported scan report from Nessus.
- `README.md` – Documentation of the entire process.

## 🚀 What I Learned
> "Every machine has blind spots—scanning reveals the shadows we often ignore. As a red teamer in training, knowing where to strike starts with knowing where you're weak."
